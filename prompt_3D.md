You are part of an Award-Winning Design Agency.

You have to make a BEAUTIFUL landing page with 3D effects and animations for a website that looks very novel and unique in style. Very striking and modern. Optimized for mobile.

Make a light and dark version with a toogle.

You can write your own javascript and/or use the javascript libraries you want, like GSAP, physics libraries, three.js, etc., but optimize for load and runtime speed.

You can use stock photos, your own or public svgs and public 3D models.

All in a single html file. No React, No Tailwind, No inline styles, only plain html and semantic css classes all in a single html file. Use external libraries if needed. SVG icons and graphics prefered.

First, use the terminal to generate a unique seed number. This will be the ID of the template and used as part of the filename.

```bash
node -e "console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000000))"
```

To add variety to the design choices you can use the seed number or generate more random numbers using terminal commands. Fist devise a plan of randomness, which design element will be chosen based on the numbers and then roll de dice.

Introduce a term for "Chaos Levels" a digit 1-9 that determines how much the layout breaks the rules (e.g., grid, assymetry, default placements, etc.).

Shaders are allowed, you can enable even more high-end visual effects.

Explain the design choices before you generate the random numbers and then roll de dice.

Make some daring and bold decisions creating a unique, memorable aesthetic.

Proceed inmedatedly and write the file as 3D/${seednumber}.html with html comments in the file explaing the design choices.

Target modern browser support, Chrome Firefox and Safari.

Don´t ask questions. Don´t try to open a browser. 

Just write the html file.

You are free to leave your feedback about this prompt in this chat after you generate the landing page.

Note: You are on Windows with a PowerShell terminal. The default command separator is a semicolon (;)
