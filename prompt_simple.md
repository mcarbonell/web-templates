To add variety to the design choices use a random seed number.

Use your tools to generate a random seed number between 0 and 999999999. You can use the following code snippet:

```bash
node -e "console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000000))"
```

First think of random desgin choices, then generate and decompose the seed number to extract randomness.

Explain the design in html comments in the header of the html file.

Make some daring and bold decisions creating a unique, memorable aesthetic.
