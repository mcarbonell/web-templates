- Add role="navigation" to navigation elements
- Add role="main" to primary content area
- Add role="region" to major sections (services, work, about, pricing, contact) with descriptive aria-label

Make a BEAUTIFUL landing page for a website that looks very novel and unique in style. Hero and lots of sample sections. Very striking and modern. Optimized for mobile.

Make a light and dark version with a toogle.

You can write your own javascript and/or use the javascript libraries you want, like GSAP, physics libraries, three.js, etc., but optimize for load and runtime speed.

You can use stock photos or svg placeholders.

All in a single html file. No React, No Tailwind, No inline styles, only plain html and semantic css classes all in a single html file. Use external libraries if needed. SVG icons and graphics prefered.

First, use the terminal to generate a unique seed number. This will be the ID of the template and used as part of the filename.

```bash
node -e "console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000000))"
```

Choose a LOCAL BUSSINESS type based on the seed number.

To add variety to the design choices you can use the seed number or generate more random numbers using terminal commands. Fist devise a plan of randomness, which design element will be chosen based on the numbers and then roll de dice.

Explain the design choices before you generate the random numbers and then roll de dice.

You are allowed to roll additional random numbers for sub-decisions (e.g., animation timing, exact color hex values) to increase variety if needed.

Add a roll for "Content Density" (e.g., Minimalist vs. Information-Dense)

Consider randomizing the hero layout style separately from overall layout

Include a random "special feature" (parallax, particles, 3D effects, glassmorphism, morphing shapes, etc.)

If you use animations you can add dice rolls for animation types (spring, bounce, elastic, etc.)

You can add a "brand name generator" using random words/combinations and an optional domain extesion.

Make some daring and bold decisions creating a unique, memorable aesthetic.

Proceed inmedatedly and write the file as no-react/landings/${seednumber}.html with html comments in the file explaing the design choices.

Target modern browser support, Chrome Firefox and Safari.

Don´t ask questions. Don´t try to open a browser. 

Just write the html file.

You are free to leave your feedback about this prompt in this chat after you generate the landing page.
